#  Rubik's Cube Rotation Predictor using CNN (Keras in Python)

This project predicts the **rotation angle** of Rubik's Cube images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of 5000 labeled cube images and aims to perform regression to predict continuous rotation values.

##  Dataset Structure

Uploaded dataset (from `archive(1).zip`) contains:

archive(1).zip
├── training/
│ ├── images/
│ └── labels.csv (filename, xRot)
├── test/
│ ├── images/


- `images/`: 512x512 RGB images of Rubik's cubes.
- `labels.csv`: Contains image filenames and corresponding rotation angles (in degrees).

##  Features

- Preprocessing and loading of high-resolution cube images
- CNN architecture built for **regression** (predicting continuous angles)
- GPU-accelerated training on **Google Colab**
- Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Option to expand model with transfer learning

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Google Colab (with GPU runtime)

##  How to Run

1. Upload `archive(1).zip` in Google Colab
2. Unzip using:

```python
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile("archive(1).zip", 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("rubiks_dataset")

    Follow notebook/code to:

        Load and preprocess images

        Build and train the CNN

        Predict and evaluate

 Model Architecture

    Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling

    Flatten → Dense(128) → Dense(1)

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error
Optimizer: Adam
 Results

After training for ~20 epochs:

    MAE (Test Set): ~1.8 degrees

    Validation Loss: Decreasing trend with early stopping

    These can vary depending on image resolution, batch size, and epochs.

 Future Scope

    Switch to transfer learning using ResNet50 or EfficientNet

    Use test data for prediction and visualization

    Turn into a web app with Flask/Streamlit for real-time cube angle prediction

    Convert to classification for fixed angle bins
